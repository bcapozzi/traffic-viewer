# traffic-viewer

Experimenting with creating a responsive UI for visualizing aircraft traffic demand in different sectors. 

Basic objective is to use Elm to create a front-end application to learn how to leverage the Elm architecture.

Specific features will be:

* Allow user to drag a timeline to move time forwards and backwards, updating plots accordingly
* As user adjusts the current time on timeline, should see the corresponding point in plots get highlighted
* As user mouses over plots, should see the closest point get highlighted
